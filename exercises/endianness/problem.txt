The terms endian and endianness refer to the convention used to interpret the bytes making up 
a data word when those bytes are stored in computer memory. In computing, memory commonly stores 
binary data by organizing it into 8-bit units called bytes. When reading or writing a data word 
consisting of multiple such units, the order of the bytes stored in memory determines the interpretation 
of the data word.

Big-endian systems store the most significant byte of a word in the smallest address 
and the least significant byte is stored in the largest address (also see Most significant bit).

Little-endian systems, in contrast, store the least significant byte in the smallest address.

Write a program, allocating a new buffer using byte array [0x3, 0x4, 0x23, 0x42], then reads a 
signed 32 bit integer from the buffer at the zero offset with little endian format and print it 
using console.log.

To get output for debugging when running `{appname} run program.js`
you should use console.error instead of console.log.
