Create a Readable stream that read data from `process.argv.slice(2)` and pipe 
it to process.stdout.

Like this:

	var spigot = new Spigot(process.argv[0]);


When you have completed your program, you can run it in the test
environment with:

  {bold}{appname} run program.js{/bold}

And once you are happy that it is correct then run:

  {bold}{appname} verify program.js{/bold}

And your submission will be verified for correctness. After you have
a correct solution, run `{bold}{appname}{/bold}` again and select the next problem!

To get output for debugging when running `{appname} run program.js`
you should use console.error instead of console.log.
