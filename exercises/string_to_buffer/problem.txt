For this challenge, converting the string 'hello buffer' to ASCII buffer, 
and then print the result using console.log.

When you have completed your program, you can run it in the test
environment with:

  {bold}{appname} run program.js{/bold}

And once you are happy that it is correct then run:

  {bold}{appname} verify program.js{/bold}

And your submission will be verified for correctness. After you have
a correct solution, run `{bold}{appname}{/bold}` again and select the next problem!

To get output for debugging when running `{appname} run program.js`
you should use console.error instead of console.log.
