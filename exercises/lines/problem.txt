Instead of transforming every line as in the previous "TRANSFORM" example,
for this challenge, convert even-numbered lines to upper-case and odd-numbered
lines to lower-case. Consider the first line to be odd-numbered. For example
given this input:

    One
    Two
    Three
    Four

Your program should output:

    one
    TWO
    three
    FOUR
