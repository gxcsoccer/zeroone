A "transform" stream is a duplex stream where the output is causally connected 
in some way to the input, such as a zlib stream or a crypto stream.

Write a program that convert data from `process.stdin` to upper-case data on 
`process.stdout`.

Try to use Transform stream:

	var Transform = require('stream').Transform;

When you have completed your program, you can run it in the test
environment with:

  {bold}{appname} run program.js{/bold}

And once you are happy that it is correct then run:

  {bold}{appname} verify program.js{/bold}

And your submission will be verified for correctness. After you have
a correct solution, run `{bold}{appname}{/bold}` again and select the next problem!

To get output for debugging when running `{appname} run program.js`
you should use console.error instead of console.log.
